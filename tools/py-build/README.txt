py-build.py -- simple build system.

I made this tool just so I don't have to deal with CMake and linking shenanigans.
This isn't a production-ready tool for large projects. It's designed for building smaller projects
that don't rely on CMake.

Note that this project uses poetry (https://python-poetry.org/) which makes it easier
to deal with dependencies and virtual environments.
